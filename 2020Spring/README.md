## Studentwork showcases, 2020 Spring

### Research statement

Aesthetic experience of everyday life involves the feeling of active interaction with the surroundings. The surroundings entails the geographical, cultural, and/or motivational context. The contexts are interweaven with our sensorymotor intelligence and eventually sediment into the meaningful aestehtic experience. Nine students explored various research questions to unveil a hidden and missing layer of information when users explore local history, social connecteness, and object to choose. We use user experience design research methods to answer for those quesiton.
