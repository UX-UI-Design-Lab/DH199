# User Research Planning 
## DH199: [YOUR TOPIC]

---

### The purpose of the user research

To find the insights from the users (or someone other than you) to solve the main design challenges you want to suggest with your ux prototype

### 

Step01: Specify the main design challenge 
What is the main activity your project would support the users?
What is the basic need involved for that activity? (reference)
What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?

Step02: Target users 
What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise) 
Where would the users do that activity? (i.e., context of use)
What would the users do to complete that activity? (e.g., goal, operation, method, action)

Step03: Pick research methods (or a combination of methods) 
Interview with direct / passive / participatory observation.
Or something you learned on your own (refer to the field guideline by IDEO)

Step04: Plan to get into the context & write down the observation/ interview guide 
Decide where to visit
Decide what activities to observe/ what to ask to do
Decide how to interact with the users 
Decide how to collect user data (ex. Pen-paper notes, voice/video recording, images)
Prepare the interview guide
