# Directed Research In Digital Humanities

## Learning Objectives/ Outcome
In this course, students will conduct an user experience design research project by utilizing the concepts, theories, and skills of digital humanities. Students will learn how to independently and collaboratively design and execute an advanced user experience design project. Individual students will produce one web-document reporting the design process in detail and one final report for publication. 



## UX Design Research Interest
* embodied cognition, learning by doing
* visual perception, psychology of design
* spatial x temporal exploration of the local history (ex. Los Angeles)
